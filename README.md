# Sales Insights Project - Tableau Dashboard

## Overview

Welcome to the **Sales Insights Project** repository! This project provides a pre-built Tableau dashboard, which you can open, customize, and interact with. The dashboard offers insights into key sales metrics such as revenue, sales quantities, and trends over time. We walk through the process of understanding individual visualizations, combining them into a comprehensive dashboard, and publishing it to Tableau Online.

The `Sales_Insights.twb` file is the Tableau workbook that contains all the sheets and dashboards created for this project.

## Key Concepts Covered

In this project, we focus on:

1. **Sheets vs Dashboards**: Learn the difference between individual sheets (single visualizations) and dashboards (combinations of multiple sheets).
2. **Label Summarization**: Summarize key sales metrics such as total revenue and sales quantity through labels.
3. **Bar Charts for Measures**: Visualize sales metrics (e.g., revenue, sales quantity) using bar charts for a clear comparison.
4. **Year and Month Filters**: Add filter buttons to the dashboard, allowing users to filter data by year and month for customized views.
5. **Revenue Trend Chart**: Track revenue performance over time using trend charts.
6. **Final Dashboard**: The workbook contains a dashboard that combines all the individual sheets, offering a holistic view of the sales data.
7. **Publishing to Tableau Online**: Learn how to publish the final dashboard on Tableau Online for easy sharing and access.

## Project Structure

The Tableau workbook (`Sales_Insights.twb`) contains the following elements:

1. **Sheets**:
   - **Revenue Summary**: A quick snapshot of total revenue generated.
   - **Sales Quantity Summary**: A summary of total sales quantities.
   - **Bar Charts for Key Measures**: Visual comparisons of key sales metrics such as revenue and sales volume.
   - **Revenue Trend**: A line chart showing revenue trends over the months and years.
2. **Dashboard**:
   - Combines the individual sheets into a single, interactive dashboard.
   - Includes buttons to filter by year and month.
3. **Filters**:
   - Year and Month filters to help slice the data for more detailed analysis.
4. **Final Dashboard**:
   - The combined view of all individual sheets, providing insights into overall sales performance.


## Final Dashboard

The final dashboard provides a combined view of:

- A summary of total revenue and sales quantity.
